# Soybean-Microbiome
Mothur Analysis of soybean microbiome for bacterial, arbuscular mycorrhiza, and broad fungal communities.

I am providing the alignment file as well as the annotation files that I used for the analysis for the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi because while I was looking for the alignment file I was not able to find it. I was able to find the read taxonomy file but not the file that Mothur would accept for alignment. I hope this is useful for others.

Files within Supporting Files directory
Raw MaarjAM Database 5 -      maarjAM.5.fasta
Aligned MaarjAM Database 5 -  maarjAM.5.aligned.fasta
MaarjAM 5 Taxonomy File -     maarjAM.id_to_taxonomy.5.txt
