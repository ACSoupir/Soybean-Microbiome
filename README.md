# Soybean-Microbiome
Mothur Analysis of soybean microbiome for bacterial, arbuscular mycorrhiza, and broad fungal communities.

I am providing the alignment file as well as the annotation files that I used for the analysis for the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi because while I was looking for the alignment file I was not able to find it. I was able to find the read taxonomy file but not the file that Mothur would accept for alignment. I hope this is useful for others.
